            <h2>World Blood Donor Day</h2>
            <p>World Blood Donor Day is celebrated on the 14th of June every year. It is being distinguished to raise awareness about saving lives by blood donations. Each year millions of people all over the world decide to donate blood and plasma; this is the reason why it has been called the World Blood Donor Day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are a number of reasons why people take part in blood donation events like World Blood Donor Day every year. First, it is a way to save the lives of many people who are affected by diseases and conditions. In addition, by donating blood, these patients will be able to continue their medical treatment, which will give them better chances to survive the disease. However, this does not mean that they have to give up their drugs or medication - they can always choose to withdraw from them if they are uncomfortable about taking them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2004 World Blood Donor Day was first distinguished by the WHO. In the 58th World Health Assembly, 2005 it was declared as an annual global event to raise awareness of the importance of blood donation. <br> Birthday of Karl Landsteiner is celebrated as World Blood Donor day, he was Austrian American immunologist, pathologist and a Nobel Prize winner in 1930 because of his development and discovery of ABO blood group system and modern blood transfusion.</p>
            <br>

If you are one of those who want to lend a hand and can't find the time to participate in blood transfusions and plasma donation, then you can make up for it by sharing your own blood. This is the easiest way to help out other people during World Blood Donor Day.</p>
