        <h2>Understanding Cardiovascular Diseases</h2>
            <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) affect your heart and blood vessels. CVDs now account for 10% of deaths and 3.8% of disability-life years of adults in Nigeria. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are the 2nd and 5th to age-specific mortality. For heart failure, the mortality rate at 1 year is 12.3%. Overall, 77.5% of men and 75.4% of women ages 60 to 79 have some form of cardiovascular disease, according to 2021 report from the American Heart Association. Among those 80 and older, 90% have it 
            </p>
            <p>
            Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases affecting your heart and blood vessels. These diseases can affect one or many parts of your heart and/or blood vessels. A person may be symptomatic (physically experiencing the disease) or asymptomatic (not feeling anything at all). Cardiovascular disease includes heart or blood vessel issues, including:
            <li class="word">Narrowing of the blood vessels in your heart, other organs or <br> throughout your body.</li>
            <li class="word">Heart and blood vessel problems present at birth.</li>
            <li class="word">Heart valves that aren’t working right.</li>
            <li class="word">Irregular heart rhythms.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
            Cardiovascular disease is among the leading causes of death worldwide and in Africa.
            Almost half of adults in the Nigeria have some form of cardiovascular disease. It also affects people of all ages, sexes, ethnicities and socioeconomic levels. One in three women and people assigned female at birth dies from cardiovascular disease.

            </p>
        <h2>Major Causes of Cardiovascular Diseases</h2>
            <p>
            The causes of cardiovascular disease can vary depending on the specific type. For example, atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in your arteries) causes coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. Coronary artery disease, scarring of your heart muscle, genetic problems or medications can cause arrhythmias. Aging, infections and rheumatic disease can cause valve diseases.
            <br>
            A risk factor is something that increases the chance of getting a condition. The more you have, the higher your chance of CVD. Even if you can’t change all your risk factors, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk.
            There are several risk factors for CVD, including:
            <li class="word">Smoking</li>
            <li class="word">Stress</li>
            <li class="word">High Blood Pressure</li>
            <li class="word">High Blood Cholesterol</li>
            <li class="word">Being Physically Inactive</li>
            <li class="word">Being overweight or obese</li>
            <li class="word">Diabetes</li>
            <li class="word">Family History of Heart Disease</li>
            <li class="word">Sex - Men are more likely to get CVD earlier than women</li>
            <li class="word">Age - The older you are, the more likely you are to get CVD</li>    
            </p>
        <h2>Symptops of Cardiovascular Diseases</h2>
            <p>
            Cardiovascular disease symptoms can vary depending on the cause. Older adults and people assigned female at birth may have more subtle symptoms. However, they can still have serious cardiovascular disease..
            <br>
            <b>Symptoms of heart issues</b>
            <li class="word">Chest pain (angina).</li>
            <li class="word">Chest pressure, heaviness or discomfort, sometimes described as a “belt around the chest” or a “weight on the chest.”</li>
            <li class="word">Shortness of breath (dyspnea).</li>
            <li class="word">Dizziness or fainting.</li>
            <li class="word">Fatigue or exhaustion.</li>
            <br>
            <b>Symptoms of blockages in blood vessels throughout your body</b>
            <li class="word">Pain or cramps in your legs when you walk.</li>

        <h2>How Can We Prevent Cardiovascular Diseases</h2>
            <p>There are several ways you can reduce your risk of developing Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>Eat a healthy, balanced diet</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, which should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains.
            You should limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day as too much salt will increase your blood pressure. 6g of salt is about 1 teaspoonful.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are 2 types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. You should avoid food containing saturated fats, because these will increase the levels of bad cholesterol in your blood.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Foods high in saturated fat include:
            <li class="word">meat pies</li>
            <li class="word">sausages and fatty cuts of meat</li>
            <li class="word">butter</li>
            <li class="word">ghee - a type of butter often used in Indian cooking.</li>
            <li class="word">lard</li>
            <li class="word">cream</li>
            <li class="word">hard cheese</li>
            <li class="word">cakes and biscuits</li>
            <li class="word">foods that contain cicnut or palm oil</li>
            <br>
            <p>
            However, a balanced diet should still include unsaturated fats, which have been shown to increase levels of good cholesterol and help reduce any blockage in your arteries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Foods high in unsaturated fat include:</p>
            <li class="word">oily fish</li>
            <li class="word">avocados</li>
            <li class="word">nuts and seeds</li>
            <li class="word">sunflower, rapeseed, olive and vegetable oils</li>
            <br>
            <p>
            You should also try to avoid too much sugar in your diet, as this can increase your chances of developing diabetes, which is proven to significantly increase your chances of developing CVD.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <b>Be more physically active</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Combining a healthy diet with regular exercise is the best way of maintaining a healthy weight. Having a healthy weight reduces your chances of developing high blood pressure.
            <br>
            Regular exercise will make your heart and blood circulatory system more efficient, lower your cholesterol level, and also keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.
            <br>
            <br>
            Exercising regularly reduces your risk of having a heart attack. The heart is a muscle and, like any other muscle, benefits from exercise. A strong heart can pump more blood around your body with less effort.
            <br>
            Any aerobic exercise, such as walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <b>Give up smoking</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you smoke, giving up will reduce your risk of developing CVD.
            <br>
            Smoking is a major risk factor for developing atherosclerosis (furring of the arteries).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <b>Reduce your alcohol consumption</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you drink, do not exceed the maximum recommended limits.
            Men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week
            <br>
            spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week
            If you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week
            <br>
            Always avoid binge drinking, as this increases the risk of a heart attack.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <b>Keep your blood pressure under control</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            You can keep your blood pressure under control by eating a healthy diet low in saturated fat, exercising regularly and, if needed, taking medicine to lower your blood pressure.
            <br>
            Your target blood pressure should be below 135/85mmHg. If you have high blood pressure, ask a GP to check your blood pressure regularly.
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm#:~:text=high%20blood%20pressure%3F-,What%20is%20blood%20pressure%3F,and%20falls%20throughout%20the%20day." target="_blank">Read more about blood pressure</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <b>Keep your diabetes under control</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            You have a greater chance of developing CVD if you have diabetes. You can help lower your risk of heart problems by being physically active and controlling your weight.
            <br>
            It’s also important to have your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels (HBA1C) checked regularly.
            <br>
            If you have diabetes and you are under the age of 80, your target blood pressure level should be below 140/90mmHg.
